# hello-world
The first of many repositories.

Dear Readers,
  I'm Jake Torres from Camas, Washington. I'm a Senior at Camas High School and I like to play soccer. I don't now much about Github, but what I do know is how to make a new branch and commit! I really appreciate the Github guide too.


//: Playground - noun: a place where people can play

import UIKit

var str = "Hello, playground"

var beginner = "Hello World"

print(beginner)

var z = 34

var x = 35

var sum = z + x

print(sum)

if (sum > 20) {
print ("Yay")
}
